      <div class="recipient">Dearest Clarissa Sheryl Natascha Maramis,</div>

      <div class="content">
        Honestly, I didn't expect to be writing for anyone this year, but within
        these last few months, you've shown me how incredibly valuable our
        friendship is, so much so that I simply had to put these feelings into
        words for you. Happy New Year, Clarissa. Let's be real, neither of us
        expected to become this close within a single year, especially since I
        thought I'd go through 2025 feeling gloomy and empty until you appeared
        and made everything so much more colorful. It all began when you asked
        me to be an asdos, which stands as one of the best decisions I've made
        all year, as it was the domino that really made us gradually grow
        closer. I started getting to know the real you during those car rides in
        Gaby's car (bless her soul) and things only became more interesting once
        you started asking for my opinions on... his stupidity. I am very
        grateful to have you as someone I can trust with my life, you've really
        given me something that I am actually very scared of losing. Thank you
        for always being there and for every single thing you've done to make me
        feel genuinely seen and cared for. I wish to dedicate everything I can
        to making you just as happy, because seeing your smile is truly the most
        amazing thing in the world. Hopefully, through these next years, I won't
        lose you or a single member of APU, because I genuinely don't know what
        I'd do without this circle. As we move into 2026, I wish you nothing but
        health, care, and a lifetime of laughs, and I pray you always remain
        true to yourself with the unwavering strength to overcome any obstacle,
        because I know you can prevail through anything. I wish you a level of
        happiness you've never experienced before and that every one of your
        dreams and aspirations is realized in the near future. I am so deeply
        proud of everything you've achieved this year Ica, well done getting
        through 2025. May God bless you abundantly in this new year and grant
        you every victory you deserve. Here's to more notes, yaps, laughs,
        smiles, and lilies with you this year. Happy New Year, my dear smart
        Star, shine everywhere you go, and never forget how amazing you truly
        are.
        <p class="special-note">
          "You are the rarest kind of soul, and You matter to me more than
          You'll ever fully realize. As we step into 2026, know that my loyalty
          to You is absolute. I'll always be by Your side, through every storm
          and every victory, today and every day after."
